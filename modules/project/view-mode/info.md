# Chat Mode

This folder contains all components related to the **Chat Mode** of the application.

## Purpose

Chat Mode is where users can:

- Interact with AI through conversational interface (same AI-driven experience as Edit Mode)
- See live preview of generated applications in isolated sandbox
- View and edit generated code
- Build applications through natural language prompts
- Work with the same project that can be switched to Edit Mode for visual manipulation

## Components

- **index.tsx**: Main ViewMode component layout
- **code-or-view/**: Left panel with Preview/Code tabs for viewing generated apps

## Layout

- **Left Panel**: Preview and Code tabs (similar to Loveable.dev, Bolt.new)
- **Right Panel**: Chat interface for AI interaction

## Similar To

- Loveable.dev's chat interface
- Bolt.new's conversational coding
- Claude Artifacts with code generation

This mode focuses on AI-driven development through conversation and immediate feedback.
