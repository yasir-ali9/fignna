# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive theming system for the fignna.com project using custom CSS variables and Tailwind CSS integration. The system will support light and dark themes with a consistent color palette and provide a theme toggle functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use semantic color variables throughout the project, so that I can maintain consistent theming and easily switch between light and dark modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is loaded THEN the system SHALL define custom CSS variables for background (bk), foreground (fg), border (bd), and accent (ac) colors
2. WHEN using Tailwind classes THEN developers SHALL be able to use semantic names like `bg-bk-50`, `text-fg-50`, `border-bd-50`
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN all color variables SHALL automatically update to reflect the new theme values
4. IF a color variable is used THEN it SHALL work consistently across all components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes, so that I can choose my preferred visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme toggle is clicked THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark themes
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and immediate
3. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the system SHALL remember the user's theme preference
4. IF no preference is set THEN the system SHALL default to the user's system preference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable theme context and toggle component, so that I can easily manage theme state across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme context is provided THEN all child components SHALL have access to theme state and toggle function
2. WHEN the toggle component is used THEN it SHALL provide a clear visual indication of the current theme
3. WHEN the theme state changes THEN all consuming components SHALL re-render with the new theme
4. IF the toggle component is imported THEN it SHALL work without additional configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized component structure, so that I can easily maintain and extend the theming system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be organized in logical folders (`components/context/`, `components/common/`)
2. WHEN the theme page is created THEN it SHALL demonstrate the theming system functionality
3. WHEN new theme-related components are added THEN they SHALL follow the established folder structure
4. IF a component uses theming THEN it SHALL be easily identifiable and maintainable
