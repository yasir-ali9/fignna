# Progress Report

This is a step-by-step guide for building the Figma + Loveable hybrid tool. Follow these steps in sequence when developing new features or setting up the project.

## Project Setup & Infrastructure

1. Created a new Next.js 15.5.2 project with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4 configuration.
2. Setup authentication system using Better Auth with Google OAuth provider and Drizzle adapter for PostgreSQL.
3. Setup database with Neon PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM with comprehensive schema for users, projects, versions, chats, and messages.
4. Configured environment variables for auth secrets, database URL, OAuth credentials, and AI API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq).
5. Setup E2B sandbox integration for code execution and project hosting with API key configuration.
6. Implemented theme system with CSS variables (bg-bk-_, text-fg-_, border-bd-_, ac-_) and React Context for dark/light mode switching.
7. Configured MobX for centralized state management following EditorEngine pattern with specialized managers.

## Core Architecture & State Management

8. Setup MobX stores architecture with EditorEngine as main orchestrator and specialized managers (StateManager, CanvasManager, ElementsManager).
9. Implemented observer pattern for all components using mobx-react-lite to ensure reactive UI updates.
10. Created scalable folder structure with app/, components/, lib/, modules/ organization for maintainability.
11. Setup CodeMirror integration for code editor functionality with syntax highlighting and autocomplete.
12. Implemented project file system with JSONB storage in database for efficient file management and version control.

## UI Components & Layout System

13. Created resizable panel system for multi-pane layout (canvas, code editor, chat, properties panel).
14. Implemented theme toggle component with smooth transitions and accessibility support.
15. Setup responsive layout system using Tailwind CSS with semantic color variables.
16. Created reusable widget components following atomic design principles.
17. Implemented error boundaries for graceful error handling across the application.

## Editor Modes & Canvas System

18. Setup three main editor modes: View Mode (preview + chat), Edit Mode (Figma-like canvas), and Code Mode (editor).
19. Implemented canvas system for visual editing with drag-and-drop functionality and element manipulation.
20. Created TSX parser for extracting React components and building layers panel similar to Figma.
21. Implemented Tailwind class parser for visual style editing and property panels.
22. Setup iframe integration for rendering live project previews within the canvas.

## AI Integration & Chat System

23. Integrated multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq) with unified interface using AI SDK.
24. Implemented chat system with message threading, conversation history, and context management.
25. Created AI-driven code generation with file system integration and real-time updates.
26. Setup streaming responses for real-time AI interaction and progressive code generation.
27. Implemented project synchronization between AI changes and visual editor updates.

## Sandbox & Deployment Integration

28. Integrated E2B sandboxes for isolated project execution and live preview generation.
29. Setup automatic project deployment to sandbox on code changes with hot reloading.
30. Implemented file synchronization between local editor and remote sandbox environment.
31. Created preview URL generation and iframe embedding for seamless project viewing.
32. Setup error handling and fallback mechanisms for sandbox connectivity issues.

## Database Operations & Version Control

33. Implemented project CRUD operations with user association and permission management.
34. Created version control system with automatic snapshots and manual commit functionality.
35. Setup chat persistence with message threading and conversation management.
36. Implemented project sharing and collaboration features with user permissions.
37. Created backup and restore functionality for project data and version history.
